## Description

This is a class that represents a valid date in c++ with the ctime tm struct. 
The order of day/month/year can be chosen, along with the delimiter between 
the values. The class uses static values for the date order and delimiter to
ensure consistency between instances of the class. This project has accompanying 
unit tests from the Google Test Library.
